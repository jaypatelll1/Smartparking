Smart Parking System
This project is a smart parking system that utilizes IR sensors to detect the occupancy status of parking spots and displays the availability of parking spots on a mobile application. This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board to control the IR sensors and process the data. The mobile application is built using React Native.

Features
Real-time detection of parking spot occupancy
Mobile application for users to view the availability of parking spots
Reservation of parking spots through the mobile application
Payment of parking fees through the mobile application
Technologies Used
Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board
IR sensors
React Native mobile application development
Cloud-based platform for data processing and analysis
Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board to the IR sensors.
Set up the cloud-based platform for data processing and analysis.
Install the required dependencies for the React Native mobile application using npm install.
Build and run the mobile application using react-native run-ios or react-native run-android.
Run the system and test the functionality.
Future Improvements
Integration with other smart city technologies such as traffic management and waste management systems
Integration with electric vehicle charging stations
Implementation of predictive parking spot availability using machine learning algorithms
